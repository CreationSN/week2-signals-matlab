# Z-Transform Analysis
What I Have Accomplished
I have successfully completed a comprehensive analysis of Z-transforms utilizing MATLAB for both computational verification and theoretical exploration. The project encompassed multiple dimensions of digital signal processing concepts.

Task 1: MATLAB Programming Implementation
A1 – Finite Sequences Analysis
I computed the Z-transforms for finite sequences and demonstrated their polynomial representations. The Region of Convergence (ROC) for finite sequences was elucidated, highlighting their convergence properties across the entire z-plane excluding singularities.

A2 – Infinite Sequences & ROC Determination
I derived analytical expressions for infinite sequences including both right-sided and left-sided sequences. The critical relationship between pole locations and ROC boundaries was extensively examined, with MATLAB validation confirming theoretical predictions.

A3 – Z-Transform Properties Verification
I applied linearity and time-shifting properties to compute transforms of modified sequences. The MATLAB symbolic toolbox provided robust verification of these fundamental properties, demonstrating consistency between analytical and computational approaches.

A4 – Inverse Z-Transform Computation
I employed both analytical inspection and MATLAB's iztrans function to recover time-domain sequences from their Z-domain representations. The correlation between pole locations and sequence characteristics was thoroughly investigated.

A5 – System Analysis & Filter Characterization
I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a given transfer function, including pole-zero plotting, frequency response computation, and filter classification. The intimate connection between pole-zero configuration and filter behavior was substantiated through graphical representations.
