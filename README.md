# Z-Transform Analysis
What I Did
I completed five MATLAB tasks about Z-transforms:

A1 - Finite Sequences

Found Z-transforms for short sequences

Learned that finite sequences work for all z-values

A2 - Infinite Sequences

Calculated Z-transforms for sequences like a‚Åøu[n]

Understood how ROC changes with different sequences

A3 - Properties

Used linearity and time-shift rules

Verified answers with MATLAB

A4 - Inverse Z-Transform

Went from Z-domain back to time-domain

Used pole locations to predict sequence type

A5 - Filter Analysis

Plotted poles and zeros on z-plane

What I Learned
Z-transforms help understand digital filters and system stability. MATLAB makes it easier to visualize complex math concepts.

Analyzed frequency response

Identified it as a band-pass filter
